{-| This is the simplest example problem: The world of a vacuum cleaner.

Let's have a complete look at how it works internally:

There are two locations, A and B, and each of them can be either clean or dirty.

    type alias State =
        { location : Location
        , a : Condition
        , b : Condition
        }

    type Location
        = A
        | B

    type Condition
        = Clean
        | Dirty


### `initialState`

At the start, both are dirty:

    initialState =
        { location = A
        , a = Dirty
        , b = Dirty
        }


### `actions`

There are three actions: Moving left, moving right, and sucking:

    type alias Action =
        State -> State

    left : Action
    left state =
        { state | location = A }

    right : Action
    right state =
        { state | location = B }

    suck : Action
    suck state =
        case state.location of
            A ->
                { state | a = Clean }

            B ->
                { state | b = Clean }

We also need to specify a step cost for each action. Let's just set it at 1 for every action. We can add the step cost to all actions like this:

    actions =
        \state ->
            List.map
                (\action -> { stepCost = 1, result = action state })
                [ left, right, suck ]


### `heuristic`

We could provide a heuristic for each state. This can speed up the search algorithms a lot when we are dealing with complex problems. Our present problem is not very complex, so we just set it at 0 for every state:

    heuristic =
        \_ -> 0


### `goalTest`

The objective of our vacuum cleaner robot is to clean both locations:

    goalTest =
        \state -> state.a == Clean && state.b == Clean

{-| Sliding Puzzle

A quadratic grid with n²-1 numbers. They are in a disturbed order and should be brought back to their natural order, by only moving around the tile with number 0. A (4²-1)-puzzle = 15-puzzle looks like this:

![15-Puzzle](https://github.com/davidpomerenke/elm-problem-solving/main/src/Problem/Example/15puzzle.png)

A sliding puzzle is represented internally as a simple list. The positions where a new line begins are determined by the square root of the length of the list.

    type alias State =
        List Int

It could be represented as a list of lists of equal lengths alternatively. (Then it is harder to deal with the equal-length assumption, though.)

{-| Knuth conjecture.

This is an artificial problem devised by Donald Knuth. (Donald Knuth is the person who is writing the book with all the algorithms in it, of which, if you understand it completely, you have high chances of getting a nice job.)

The idea is that every number can be represented by starting from 4 and then repeatedly applying one of these three functions:

  - Factorial!
  - √Square Root
  - ⌊Floor operation⌋ (that is, rounding downwards)

We want to find the sequence of concatenated functions to arrive at a given number.

Internally, this looks like so:

    type alias State =
        Float

    actions =
        \n ->
            if toFloat (round n) == n then
                [ { stepCost = 1, result = sqrt n }
                , { stepCost = 1, result = toFloat (factorial (round n)) }
                ]

            else
                [ { stepCost = 1, result = toFloat (floor n) }
                , { stepCost = 1, result = sqrt n }
                ]

{-| Find a route of nodes in a graph.

The implementation is very straightforward:

        , heuristic = \_ -> 0
        , goalTest = (==) goal
        , stateToString = nodeToString
        }

Heuristics are not yet supported, unfortunately. (The reason is that I am not sure how best to deal with heuristics that are only defined for a subset of nodes, such as `romania.bucharestDistance`.)
