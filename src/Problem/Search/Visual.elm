# Search progress

@docs scatter


# Search tree

These two visualizations present the search graph in the form of a tree or a tree map. This neglects that the search graph is actually not a tree but a graph. It allows for very neat and compact visualizations.

@docs tree, treeMap


# Search graph

This visualizes the graph as it is: As a graph.

@docs GraphModel, graph

I recommend to have a look at [this simple example](https://github.com/davidpomerenke/elm-problem-solving/blob/main/examples/3-graph-example) of how the graph data model can be embedded into an application.


# Tooltip

A tooltip is an info box displayed when hovering over an element with the mouse. It shows a visualization of the search state, and some basic information about its position in the search tree.

This is not yet supported for all problems and search diagrams.

-- GRAPH


{-| A good graph visualization is computationally a bit more complicated, and therefore this visualization has its own data model that needs to be updated and queried. We need to embed it as a kind of sub-model into our application.
-}

    Graph.Model a


{-| We use these three functions to initialize and update the graph data model, and finally, to display the actual graph.
