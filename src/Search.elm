# Informed search


# Accessing progress while searching

This is useful if you want to work with the internal model of the search algorithms from the `Search` module.

For example:

  - For making animations of how the algorithms work.
  - For extensive logging. Or for just displaying the number of explored states.

However, these algorithms are much slower than their equivalents from the `Search` module. In my opinion they should have the same time efficiency as the algorithms from the `Search` module, but I have to investigate this further, as the algorithms here seem to slow down pretty quickly.

You can use the functions from this module to embed the inner structure of the search algorithm (the `SearchModel`) into the model of your web application.

Here is a minimal example, which you can also find in the [`Search/ComponentMinimal`](../../../../examples/Search/ComponentMinimal/src/Main.elm) example. A logging use case can be found in the [`Search/Component`](../../../../examples/Search/Component/src/Main.elm) example.

    module Main exposing (..)

    import Browser
    import Html exposing (text)
    import Search.Component exposing (SearchModel, breadthFirstSearch, searchInit)
    import Search.NPuzzle exposing (simpleEightPuzzle)

    type alias State =
        List Int

    type Msg
        = SearchOn ( SearchModel State, SearchModel State -> Cmd Msg )

    main : Program () (SearchModel State) Msg
    main =
        let
            searchModel =
                searchInit simpleEightPuzzle
        in
        Browser.element
            { view = \model -> text (Debug.toString model)
            , init = \_ -> ( searchModel, breadthFirstSearch SearchOn searchModel )
            , update =
                \msg model ->
                    case msg of
                        SearchOn ( result, callback ) ->
                            ( result, callback result )
            , subscriptions = always Sub.none
            }

In this example, the model of the application _is_ the model of the search algorithm. In a real scenario, it would most likely reside as a sub-model within the application model. You can look that up in the [`Search/Component`](../../../../examples/Search/Component/src/Main.elm) example.
